                    <p >The seed was planted in the heart of a small nucleus of teenagers whose lives crossed one another's 
                        paths in the Mid-Hudson Valley in upstate New York. At a young age they dedicated their hearts to God 
                        and lives to ministry and serving others. With the help and support of nurturing parents and supportive 
                        churches, they started a faith-based nonprofit ministry. It was launched as an evangelistic tool to provide 
                        inspiration, encouragement, as well as wholesome and nurturing environments and activities for other young people. 
                        After Derek, one of the three, left for college to prepare for pastoral ministry, the team gradually began shiftting 
                        its focus to serving felt-needs in under-resourced communities. Upon finishing college and entering his first pastorate 
                        in the state of Mississippi, he began his work by combining a traditional pastoral approach with a community-development 
                        emphasis to serve the needs of the congregation and community. Since those early days all of them - Derek Lane, Joe Sparks, 
                        and David Guerrero, have spent the last thirty-plus years engaged in various aspects of ministry with a goal of encouraging
                        others and empowering communities.
