                    In the fast-paced, ever-changing philanthropic world and non-profit sector, survival is all about the ability to adapt.
                    Sustainability and relevance is about staying ahead of the curb, monitoring trends while simultaneously remaining true 
                    to your values and the mission that birthed your organization and its mission in the first place.
                    The ability of a community or faith-based organization to grow its organizational and financial capacity is dependent upon; <br/>

                    Strategic Planning – The ability to properly manage and balance the operational and programmatic-side of your organization. <br/>
                    Nurturing Relationships – The work of engaging relationally with your 3 core constituents – clients, staff & volunteers, and supporters <br/>
                    Resource Development – Stewarding resources with a level of intentionality and leveraging resources for continued sustainability. <br/>
                    Capacity-building requires visionary and shared leadership and the continued work of attracting others to a cause worth fighting for.
