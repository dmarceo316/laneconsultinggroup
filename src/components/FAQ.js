                A hosting agency can approach this in one of three ways; <br/>
                1) It can opt out of a minimum requirement altogether and make the training availalble "in house" 
                or for staff members only. The cost for an in-house professional development workshop is $1,500. <br/>
                2) It can pay a hosting fee of $1,500 to avoid a minimum class participation requirement and 
                receive a portion of the registration fee for every participant who registers or, <br/>
                3) It can avoid a hosting fee by meeting the minimum number of 20 pre-registered participants. The host organization 
                will then receive compensation at the rate of $20/participant after the 20th person registers.
